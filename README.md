# Computer Graphics Fundamentals
Contains laboratories and projects developed during the Computer Graphics Fundamentals Course, UPB, ACS 2021
This repository contains only the code I have personally written, building upon the framework (OpenGL 3.3, GLFW, GLEW, GLM, ASSIMP, STB, Closed Source) that has been provided by the course team, running these projects not being possibile in the current state.

More details about each project in their corresponding folder.
